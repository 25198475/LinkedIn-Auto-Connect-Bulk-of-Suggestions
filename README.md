# LinkedIn-Auto-Connect-Bulk-of-Invitations

1 - Copy & Paste this code in the Developer Console After opening (https://www.linkedin.com/people/pymk?)

2 - You have to stop manually by exiting the tab, to stop sending requests to the suggested users.

3 - This code was orignally written by Tanvir Zafar (http://howpk.com/how-to-increase-linkedin-connections-bot-script/). I just fixed some errors, refactored the code and provided code commenting.

Future work: Stop it after assigning some input in the variable. Adding some predictable user behavior by giving ramdom set interval after each hit.
